Keeney Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Kelly Meredith Ride To Give 3.0 4065 George Abrams 1108 Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

"About us... We are a family of 6 on one
        income. I am a stay at home mom of 4 amazing kids. I have one
        daughter who is 17.  I have two middle sons, ages 14 and 13.
        They have autistic disorders but have come a LONG way with all
        the help and support of friends, family, teachers, coaches,
        therapist and God. Then we had Kyle.  Kyle is our first son who
        is ""normal"" and now I just found out he is moderate
        Protan color blind.  What does that mean?  Well anything with
        red in it he doesn't see correctly. Purples look blue b/c the red portion of the color purple is
        missing. Red sometimes looks black . Orange and green can look
        like each other. Most stuff looks like a weird brownish green . His world is
        shades of brown/green with blue , yellow , black and white. It breaks my heart because I
        LOVE colors.  I love r a i n b o w s , and crystals and holiday decorations. I love
        fall leaves, flowers , fireworks and M & M's . How do these things
        look to him?  Probably dreary. Kyle is 8 years old and is in
        3rd grade. He LOVES riding his dirt bike , playing soccer,
        building things and helping his dad with what ever project he is
        working on. He is a dare devil and talks nonstop.  We suspected
        for years that he may be colorblind but we didn't understand the
        condition. So when we would do our little tests and ask him
        ""What color is this?"", if he got it right, we assumed
        he could see fine and must be playing a trick on us. Now I get
        it, and it's not that simple. He has learned what we call red and what we call orange.  He
        doesn't however see it like we do.  In fact they are all so
        close in color to him he has a hard time telling them apart at
        all. It all depends on the lighting and how far away the thing
        is. Color blindness runs in my
          family and on my husbands side as well, but we thought we were
          in the clear. Maybe in denial. After having some teachers
          voice their concerns, and the many times he called something
          the wrong color, we  finally just had him
        tested...twice.  I believe it now. It's effecting his school
        situations as well as his sports.  And I would assume,  just his
        everyday enjoyment of life. I know he doesn't know what he's
        missing, but I do. We take seeing in color for granted. Color
        brings joy to us though.  I have probably done all I can to help
        my older boys with their autism, I'd like to do what I can to
        help Kyle. This fundraiser is to raise
          money to buy Kyle a pair of glasses that will help him
        see the colors he's missing.  It helps 75% of people who try
        them.  We have been saving for a few years and we are finally
        taking our kids to Florida for a week in November (12th-18th) of
        this year. Kyle's 9th birthday is November 13th. We will be
        spending his whole birthday at Disney's Magic Kingdom! We are
        also going to Disney's Animal Kingdom, the ocean, and
          Universal Studio's islands of adventure.  I would LOVE for him
          to see Disney, Universal and the beach in all it's glory with a pair of these glasses. He will also get to see the
        fireworks in full color! PLEASE help my son! Any donation no
        matter how small will make a difference. I want to be able to
        hand him a wrapped gift on the way to Florida and have him open
        it and experience the world the way we see it. IN FULL COLOR! 
        Like Dorothy in the ""Wizard of Oz"".  It would be the
        best birthday ever!  THANK YOU! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

"About John John has been color blind since
    birth. When he was first in school his teacher was concerned because
    he would only use crayon with their color label still attached.

    John's father, was doing research for his graduate degree, he
    discovered that John was Red-green color blind. People John meets
    these days can't tell he is colorblind because John work's daily to
    strengthen his ability to distinguish colors. To this day he can't
    tell the difference between cantaloupe and honeydew. John's accomplishments John has taken many art classes. He

"Hello! My name is Yvonne Foong, I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type
  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumors to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumors whenever needed to preserve my life. In November 2017, I need to under go surgery again to remove multiple
  large tumors called schwannoma from both my arms. They have made my
  fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I loose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily
  living needs despite her advanced age.  So I must go for surgery with
  doctors who can do better to save my arms before it is too late. Some brief details about the surgery: Where: St Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. By Who: Dr. Gregory P Lekovic, Neurosurgeon.

"For those of you who do not know Ben Durst personally, I am sorry.
  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to
  send a donation via snail-mail, please email me at parisuze@yahoo.com , or Cancer2017SUCKS@yahoo.com . Thank you for your generosity. Everyone loves a comedian.

"DID YOU KNOW? Donny has red/green color deficiency o r
          ""colorblindness"" So while he can see most color he
          struggles to see certain colors or certain colors look
          different to him than to you and I. It's difficult to say if
          he even sees ""real"" colors the way we do. We play
          the ""what color is this?"" game a lot. -Sometimes Don can't
          differentiate between Guacamole and Bean dip without having to
          taste it since sometimes they are the same color to him. -He gave his sister food
          poisoning once because he couldn't tell that the chicken he
          cooked was still pink. (pink tends to look grey to him) -Speaking of which, this one
          time we were playing the Slug Bug game and this light blue beetle was driving by and he
          yelled ""PINK SLUG BUG"" before punching me- he
          cheated and we haven't played that game since. -He has to change the color
          options in his video games. Bad guys = red, team
          members=green, yeah... he can't tell most of the time so he
          ends up losing a lot because he doesn't shoot the bad guy or
          he shoots his own team member. (it's actually pretty cute when
          he plays with his little brother. The little brother sometimes
          coaches him ""Shoot!"" ""Don't shoot!"")
          You'll be surprised how many video games don't give color
          alternatives for red/green -Certain shades of Purple =
          Blue or vice versa in his world. I don't think he could see
          our wedding colors properly. I'm pretty sure he agreed to the
          color because I liked it and didn't want to disappoint me. -I've caught him asking little
          kids what colors were. Not because that's an adult thing to do
          but because he truly doesn't know . -When we shop he usually asks
          me ""what color are these?"" I've rescued him many
          times from buying the worst poop-colored pants. So. Many. Times. There's a ton more stories
          about Don and his color deficiency but it's part of our daily
          life we don't realize how lacking it
          truly is until its put in perspective, which makes for some
          funny stories. He's wanted to get these
          glasses forever. Life happens and we haven't been able to
          splurge on getting them. With your support we'd love for him
          to finally get them! Our goal is to get him two pairs, both
          the indoor and outdoor pair. Of course if we can get one of
          them funded, he'd be just as ecstatic. We'd be thankful for any

"I was out walking with Joel
      yesterday, admiring the beauty of the leaves changing. I pointed
      out how bright the red leaves that stood alone on a branch on a
      tree that the rest of the leaves were still green. He asked
      ""where?"" They were right in front of us and the stark
      contrast was incredible. He simply couldn't see it. It really
      motivated me to save up for those enchroma glasses for him. With
      him being color blind, he is unable to see the difference between
      the oranges reds and greens. The only color he was able to pick
      apart, was yellow. They all kind of blend together for him. I
      wanted to cry. He has been missing out on SO MUCH. The look on his
      face when he gets to see the colors will be worth the $400. I'm

"Their Story Hello Everyone, My name is Carrie and I have the
      pleasure of being a daughter and an Aunt to wonderful people. My
      father is in his 60s and has spent his entire life not being able
      to see all the colors in the rainbow. He has had carpenter jobs
      and has worked with cars, but has always had limitations. My
      father's art is truly amazing, but there is never colors. I want
      him to be able to add colors to his art and not have limitations.
      My two nephews will also spend a life without all the colors
      unless we can change that. The other day I pointed out a rainbow
      that was in the sky before I realized that they might not see it.
      The rainbow was faint appearing. My nephew must have stared in the
      sky for a good ten minutes trying to see it all. I want to give
      the gift of color vision to my family. Please contribute by
      donating and sharing their story. I hope to raise enough money to
      at least buy adult Enchroma glasses for my father to wear and the

"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long

    remember.  He can see some colors, but most of them end up blending
    together to all look the same, especially when they are close to
    each other or slight variations. He often tells me about how in
    school when it came time to do geography and look at maps he was so
    embarrassed that he had to go tell the teachers that he can’t tell
    the difference in the colors on the maps.  I would love to get these

    to take him to a car show (something he is so passionate about) to
    see all the colors he has been missing out on. To wake him up early
    to see a sunrise and all the beautiful colors that he can’t tell a
    difference between.  I just know this will blow his mind and he will
    love it.  Any help you can give will go directly to this purchase.

  set up this fundraising page as a way to not only raise money towards
  my medical expenses but to also keep family, friends and colleagues
  updated on my recovery journey. I'm humbly reaching out to you all for your financial support.

"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . *Notice: We are experiencing some delays with kit turnover, so
    please allow 2-3 weeks for your kit to arrive.* Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

    but side jobs. He was a mechanic and painter a nd
    his main career was for 30+years as a Manager and District Manager
    in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies

"At the age of only 39, Dustan Leyba has been diagnosed with stage 4
  cervical cancer. Treatment is not only necessary, but urgent. The
  tumors are throughout her body, and the two biggest are the sizes of a
  baseball and a basketball. This is very serious, and requires a lot of
  time, money, and effort. She is a mother to her three children who still live at home, the
  youngest being only a year old. She is the matriarch of seven
  children, three of which have children of their own, making her a
  grandmother as well. She has every reason and right to fight this
  battle and money should not be a worry for her, we've set up this
  campaign to ease her mind and stress as she undergoes chemo,
  surgeries, and radiation. This money will also cover taking care of
  her two youngest toddlers while her husband and son work to pay bills
  as well. We want her to win this battle, and she will, but the added help
  financially is at times life saving. Without previous contributions,
  we would not have made it to the tumor institute in Boise last minute.
  We have been so blessed by the caring people who've decided to
  contribute to my mother's cause. Truly, truly blessed. We are holding an art auction on Instagram to raise money, please

"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from

"The past month has been the most excruciating I have ever known but
  within it has been Jaspers fight for life. Each day of the first 3
  weeks had presented numerous challenges both large and small and he
  has shown thus far that he is meeting them. He is now physically stable. Jasper suffered a major seizure the evening of 2/12/16. The
  severity of which has left him with anoxic brain injury (this is
  similar to a stroke). The complexity of this condition and the
  complete unknown aspect of what lies ahead in terms of recovery is
  what is being faced at this time. Jasper has weathered the
  'neurological storms' that came upon him as a result of this injury.
  These were very severe and difficult to bear. Doctors stated that
  these ""storms"" could last days, weeks, years or never cease.
  The absolutely wonderful news is his neurological storms have subsided
  after less than a month and he has been slowly awakening from this state. He has begun to move both legs, move his eyes ( visual
  tracking) and to turn his head. Very positive steps forward. He
  responds to touch and stimuli and a few times- though not yet
  consistent-we saw a smile......it was beautiful to see! Julianne, Jasper's mom (03/29/16) What we do know is that his recovery is going to be a long
  road. He is facing years of rehabilitation, initially in a
  facility equipped to deal with rebuilding his physical  and cognitive
  abilities. This is going to be costly and we need your help . Your generous donations will be
  used to ensure that Jasper is able to get the care he needs to reclaim
  his life.","54,275",of $200k goal,https://fundrazr.com/f17Vw9,Jasper's fund,532,,U.S. Dollar

"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.","7,290",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle,Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,46,"Jul 1, 2018",Canadian Dollar
"Since 2008, Serenity has been battling breast cancer and winning
  thanks in part to everyone's kindness and generosity, especially her
  dad. On November 12, 2011, Serenity’s breast cancer was back. This
  time in her bones, right lung, left thyroid and ovaries. She again
  fought for her life with STAGE IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. Thanks to
  the success of ART4LIFE on March 23, 2012 she was
  treated at MD Anderson in Houston, Texas. The best facility
  nationwide, some say worldwide. Her quality of life is much better
  since being treated at MD Anderson and her son, Shade, feels better
  knowing she is in less pain and living a better quality of life. On April 24, 2017 Serenity's dad suddenly passed unexpectedly.
  He has been one of the main financial contributors throughout her
  battle. As well as what she describes as her ""Rock"". Never
  giving up on her and being so brave and emotionally supportive
  throughout her battle. Her mom, a retired nurse, has also been by
  Serenity's side to support her through her surgeries and doctor visits. Since 2012 to present day the expenses for her care and travels to
  and from Texas are astronomical and this is why we are holding the
  2017 ART4LIFE benefit. The ART4LIFE benefit will raise funds that will go
  directly to health and travel expenses. ART4LIFE will
  be an open bid auction. We will have artwork, photography, handmade
  jewelry as well as other items that have been donated for auction. We would be honored and very appreciative if you would donate. Facebook: Serenity's Cancer Journey","2,500",of $25k goal,https://fundrazr.com/b1EyY1,Serenity needs help with her continued cancer care,11,"Nov 1, 2017",U.S. Dollar

  Air Force Veteran, a cancer survivor, and a lover of life. When Ron
  was told that he was in full remission, after a long, difficult, 8
  year battle, it was like the doctor handed back his excitement and
  appreciation of absolutely everything. He never passes an opportunity
  to live and take in the moments that this world has to offer. He has
  always told me that he wished he could see color as most people do.
  His greens and reds all look like browns. He has no vibrancy to
  yellows, oranges, or pinks. I want to give him an opportunity to try
  these glasses in the hopes that he can expierience the vibrancy and
  beauty of life, as I know it to be. When I look at Ron, I see the
  worlds most beautiful colors. The brightest yellow that shines warmer
  than the sun, the most beautiful blue that brings comfort to so many,
  and the deepest red that could define what love really means just by
  looking at it. He is such pure goodness and does so much for so many.
